# Pathway-Explorer
Create a systemic approach for visualizing pathways by mapping patientsâ€™ journey through the hospital and critical points of care.  This tool would help us explore the observable deviations within pathways in order to model potential future states. It would also allow us to understand the actual scope of variation in expected outcomes or within pathways, and provide evidence to improve patients care.
